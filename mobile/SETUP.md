# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Important: Security Notice
Firebase configuration files contain sensitive API keys and should NOT be committed to version control.

## Setup Steps

1. **Firebase Configuration Files**
   - `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Generated by FlutterFire CLI
   - `android/app/google-services.json` - For Android
   - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` - For iOS

2. **Generate firebase_options.dart**
   ```bash
   # Install FlutterFire CLI
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

   # Configure Firebase for your project
   flutterfire configure
   ```

3. **Download Platform-Specific Files**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Project Settings
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
   - Place them in the correct directories as listed above

4. **API Key Security**
   - NEVER commit API keys to public repositories
   - Use Firebase Security Rules to protect your data
   - Restrict API key usage in Google Cloud Console

## After Cloning This Repository

1. Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart`
2. Download and place the platform-specific configuration files
3. Ensure these files are in .gitignore

## Google Cloud Console Actions Required

Due to the exposed API key, please:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials
3. Delete or regenerate the exposed API key
4. Create new restricted API keys
5. Update your Firebase project with new keys
